# Project-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-for-Customer-Market-Segmentation

## Problem
Apply unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation.

## Data Columns
CUSTID: Identification of Credit Card holder 
BALANCE: Balance amount left in customer's account to make purchases
BALANCE_FREQUENCY: How frequently the Balance is updated, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently updated, 0 = not frequently updated)
PURCHASES: Amount of purchases made from account
ONEOFFPURCHASES: Maximum purchase amount done in one-go
INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: Amount of purchase done in installment
CASH_ADVANCE: Cash in advance given by the user
PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: How frequently the Purchases are being made, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)
ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: How frequently Purchases are happening in one-go (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)
PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: How frequently purchases in installments are being done (1 = frequently done, 0 = not frequently done)
CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY: How frequently the cash in advance being paid
CASH_ADVANCE_TRX: Number of Transactions made with "Cash in Advance"
PURCHASES_TRX: Number of purchase transactions made
CREDIT_LIMIT: Limit of Credit Card for user
PAYMENTS: Amount of Payment done by user
MINIMUM_PAYMENTS: Minimum amount of payments made by user  
PRC_FULL_PAYMENT: Percent of full payment paid by user
TENURE: Tenure of credit card service for user
